# REMINDER: Only do one challenge at a time! Save and test after every one.

# Challenge 0: Remember, what's the first thing you should add to any Python
# file you are working with?
# (Answer: add a "print", to make sure you are editing the right file!)

print("Hello Functions World!")

print('Challenge 1 -------------')
# Challenge 1:
# 1. Create 3 variables. Store in them:
#   - your name
#   - your favorite color
#   - how many hours of sleep you got last night
# 2. Print out all 3 values using "print".

name = "Maria"
favorite_color = "Blue"
hours_sleep = "8"
print(name, favorite_color, hours_sleep)



print('Challenge 2 -------------')
# Challenge 2:
# Create a list of your favorite book authors.
# Put it into a variable called "authors_list".

authors_list = ['ferlinghetti', 
                'waltman', 
                'sparks',]
print(authors_list)



print('Challenge 3 -------------')
# Challenge 3:
# Write an "if-statement" to check if the top author on that list is equal to
# "Douglas Adams". If it is, print "Don't panic!". Otherwise, print "Panic!"

# Hint: The very first author is accessible with authors_list[0]

if authors_list == ('Douglas Adams'):
    print("Don\'t panic!")
else:
    print("Panic!")



print('Challenge 4 -------------')
# Challenge 4:
# 1. Uncomment the provided code. What does it do?
# 2. Using a while loop, use this as a clue to write code to "loop through"
# your favorite authors list, printing each one on a separate line, along with
# its index.

#i = 0
#print(authors_list[i])
#length = len(authors_list)
#print('There are', length,  'favorite authors')

# Challenge 4 hint: The following lines of code might be helpful, although not
# necessarily in this order or indentation:
#          i = i + 1
#          while i < length:

## Answer MM ##
# i = 0
# length = len(authors_list)
# print('There are', length,  'favorite authors')
# while i < length:
#     i = i + 1
#     print(authors_list[i])

## Answer MB ##
i = 0
length = len(authors_list)
while i < length:
    print(i, authors_list[i])
    i += 1



print('Challenge 5 -------------')
# Challenge 5:
# 1. Uncomment the provided code. What does it do?
# 2. Using this a start, create a while loop that keeps on looping until the
# user says "yes". Have it print back whatever they say each time it loops.

#user_input = input('Should I stop? ')

x = 'yes'
while user_input != x:
    user_input = input('Should I stop? ')
    print(user_input)

# x = 0
# print("We need to ask your name 3 times.")
# while x < 3:
#     x = x + 1
#     name = input('What is your name? ')
#     print("Hi", name)
    





print('-------------')
# Bonus Challenge:
# Create a chat bot!
# - Using a dictionary and a while / input loop, every time a user enters text
# check in the dictionary for a pre-set set of replies (e.g. "hi" responds with
# "hello").
# - It should exit if the person says "bye" or something similar.
# - How can you make it more robust and respond to more spelling or grammar
# differences?
